The Algorithm:

predict(user, movie)
	get most_similar users to user
	for each of the most similar users
		if the user has rated the movie
			add thier rating to the total
			increase the count of movies

	return the average rating

most_similar(user)
	sort the users in the training set by similiarity to the user. Most similar appear first

similarity(user, user2)
	get all the movies both users have seen

	for each movie that they have in common
		add 1 minus their difference in rating/3

The advantages are that it will be using the most similar users to the user for each prediction it is making. This can be changes but just changing the similarity method.The disadvantage is that the most_similar method takes a long time to run for each user, making the total time very long if there are many different users for predictions.

The running time is increasing exponentially, so if the user set was to increase by 1000 or 10000, it would take a very long time to run through a set of predictions for every users, as the most_similar method goes though ever single user in the set.
